# RubiksCubeRobotSolver
A Rubik's Cube Robot solver powered by MSP432

## Description
This project aims to solve a Rubik's Cube puzzle only with a microcontroller. I used the MSP432 from TI and the present code is developped using the "driverlib" library for this microcontroller.

However, the resolution algorithm and the whole process to solve the cube is independant and could be used with any other solution (computer of microcontroller).

The project was developped by myself for the final project of the ME6405 Mechatronics at Georgia Institute Of Technology, Atlanta GA. This course was dispensed by [Dr Rogers](http://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/jonrogers) during the Fall 2017 term.
